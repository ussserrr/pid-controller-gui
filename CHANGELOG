New features:
    + Demo mode: activates when there is no connection at the start moment
    + Saving PID configuration in MCU's EEPROM
    + Input new IP/PORT, save them on PC under any OS (by QSettings)

Changes:
    ~ When connection with MCU lost MessageWindow appears only once: after that there is only statusbar message
    ~ Graphics moved in module 'miscgraphics' (refresh PicButton, matplotlib Graph, MessageWindow)
    ~ MCUconn module renamed to 'mcuconn', nice improvements in architecture, 'connection lost' handling, new functions
    ~ Improvements in main module architecture (FormWidget class is now a part of MainWindow class; import only used names)
    ~ Variables and functions names refactoring
    ~ Other nice small changes
